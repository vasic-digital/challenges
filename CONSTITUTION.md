# Challenges — Constitution

> **Status:** Active. This document is the project's authoritative
> rule set. When a rule here conflicts with `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
> or any guide, the Constitution wins.

## Mission

See README.md.

## Mandatory Standards

1. **Reproducibility:** every change is reproducible from a clean
   clone (`git clone <repo> && <project bootstrap>`); no hidden steps.
2. **Tests track behavior, not code:** test what the user-visible
   behavior is, not what the implementation looks like.
3. **No silent skips, no silent mocks above unit tests.**
4. **Conventional Commits** for all commits.
5. **SSH-only for git operations** (`git@…`); HTTPS prohibited.

## Numbered Rules

<!-- Rules are numbered CONST-NNN. New rules append. Removed rules
     keep their number with a "**Retired:** …" line. -->

<!-- BEGIN host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->

### CONST-033 — Host Power Management is Forbidden

**Status:** Mandatory. Non-negotiable. Applies to every project,
submodule, container entry point, build script, test, challenge, and
systemd unit shipped from this repository.

**Rule:** No code in this repository may invoke a host-level power-
state transition (suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, suspend-then-
hibernate, poweroff, halt, reboot, kexec) on the host machine. This
includes — but is not limited to:

- `systemctl {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot,kexec}`
- `loginctl {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot}`
- `pm-{suspend,hibernate,suspend-hybrid}`
- `shutdown {-h,-r,-P,-H,now,--halt,--poweroff,--reboot}`
- DBus calls to `org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep,SuspendThenHibernate,PowerOff,Reboot}`
- DBus calls to `org.freedesktop.UPower.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep}`
- `gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type` to any value other than `'nothing'` or `'blank'`

**Why:** The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI-agent and
container workloads. On 2026-04-26 18:23:43 the host was auto-
suspended by the GDM greeter's idle policy mid-session, killing
HelixAgent and 41 dependent services. Recurring memory-pressure
SIGKILLs of `user@1000.service` (perceived as "logged out") have the
same outcome. Auto-suspend, hibernate, and any power-state transition
are unsafe for this host.

**Defence in depth (mandatory artifacts in every project):**
1. `scripts/host-power-management/install-host-suspend-guard.sh` —
   privileged installer, manual prereq, run once per host with sudo.
   Masks `sleep.target`, `suspend.target`, `hibernate.target`,
   `hybrid-sleep.target`; writes `AllowSuspend=no` drop-in; sets
   logind `IdleAction=ignore` and `HandleLidSwitch=ignore`.
2. `scripts/host-power-management/user_session_no_suspend_bootstrap.sh` —
   per-user, no-sudo defensive layer. Idempotent. Safe to source from
   `start.sh` / `setup.sh` / `bootstrap.sh`.
3. `scripts/host-power-management/check-no-suspend-calls.sh` —
   static scanner. Exits non-zero on any forbidden invocation.
4. `challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh` — asserts
   the running host's state matches layer-1 masking.
5. `challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh` — wraps the
   scanner as a challenge that runs in CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`.

**Enforcement:** Every project's CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`
equivalent MUST run both challenges (host state + source tree). A
violation in either channel blocks merge. Adding files to the
scanner's `EXCLUDE_PATHS` requires an explicit justification comment
identifying the non-host context.

**See also:** `docs/HOST_POWER_MANAGEMENT.md` for full background and
runbook.

<!-- END host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->

## Definition of Done

A change is done when:

1. The code change is committed.
2. All project-level tests pass on a clean clone.
3. All challenges in `challenges/scripts/` pass on the running host.
4. Governance docs (`CONSTITUTION.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) are
   coherent with the change.

## MANDATORY HOST-SESSION SAFETY (Constitution §12)

**Forensic incident, 2026-04-27 22:22:14 (MSK):** the developer's
`user@1000.service` was SIGKILLed under an OOM cascade triggered by
`pip3 install --user openai-whisper` running on top of chronic
podman-pod memory pressure. The cascade SIGKILLed gnome-shell, every
ssh session, claude-code, tmux, btop, npm, node, java, pip3 — full
session loss. Evidence: `journalctl --since "2026-04-27 22:00"
--until "2026-04-27 22:23"`.

This invariant applies to **every script, test, helper, and AI agent**
in this submodule. Non-compliance is a release blocker.

### Forbidden — directly OR indirectly

1. **Suspending the host**: `systemctl suspend`, `pm-suspend`,
   `loginctl suspend`, DBus `org.freedesktop.login1.Suspend`,
   GNOME idle-suspend, lid-close handler.
2. **Hibernating / hybrid-sleeping**: any `Hibernate` / `HybridSleep`
   / `SuspendThenHibernate` method.
3. **Logging out the user**: `loginctl terminate-session`,
   `pkill -u <user>`, `systemctl --user --kill`, anything that
   signals `user@<uid>.service`.
4. **Unbounded-memory operations** inside `user@<uid>.service`
   cgroup. Any single command expected to exceed 4 GB RSS MUST be
   wrapped in `bounded_run` (defined in
   `scripts/lib/host_session_safety.sh`, parent repo).
5. **Programmatic rfkill toggles, lid-switch handlers, or
   power-button handlers** — these cascade into idle-actions.
6. **Disabling systemd-logind, GDM, or session managers** "to make
   things faster" — even temporary stops leave the system unable to
   recover the user session.

### Required safeguards

Every script in this submodule that performs heavy work (build,
transcription, model inference, large compression, multi-GB git op)
MUST:

1. Source `scripts/lib/host_session_safety.sh` from the parent repo.
2. Call `host_check_safety` at the top and **abort if it fails**.
3. Wrap any subprocess expected to exceed ~4 GB RSS in
   `bounded_run "<name>" <max-mem> <max-time> -- <cmd...>` so the
   kernel OOM killer is contained to that scope and cannot escalate
   to user.slice.
4. Cap parallelism (`-j`) to fit available RAM (each AOSP job ≈ 5 GB
   peak RSS).

### Container hygiene

Containers (Docker / Podman) we own or rely on MUST:

1. Declare an explicit memory limit (`mem_limit` / `--memory` /
   `MemoryMax`).
2. Set `OOMPolicy=stop` in their systemd unit to avoid retry loops.
3. Use exponential-backoff restart policies, never immediate retry.
4. Be clean-slate destroyed (`podman pod stop && rm`, `podman
   volume prune`) and rebuilt after any host crash or session loss
   so stale lock files don't keep producing failures.

### When in doubt

Don't run heavy work blind. Check `journalctl -k --since "1 hour ago"
| grep -c oom-kill`. If it's non-zero, **fix the offending workload
first**. Do not stack new work on a host already in distress.

## MANDATORY ANTI-BLUFF COVENANT — END-USER QUALITY GUARANTEE (User mandate, 2026-04-28) (CONST-035)

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (verbatim):**

> "We had been in position that all tests do execute with success
> and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the
> features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the
> case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the
> quality, the completion and full usability by end users of the
> product!"

This is the historical origin of the project's anti-bluff covenant.
Every test, every Challenge, every gate, every mutation pair exists
to make the failure mode (PASS on broken-for-end-user feature)
mechanically impossible.

**Operative rule:** the bar for shipping is **not** "tests pass"
but **"users can use the feature."** Every PASS in this codebase
MUST carry positive evidence captured during execution that the
feature works for the end user. Metadata-only PASS, configuration-
only PASS, "absence-of-error" PASS, and grep-based PASS without
runtime evidence are all critical defects regardless of how green
the summary line looks.

**Tests AND Challenges (HelixQA) are bound equally** — a Challenge
that scores PASS on a non-functional feature is the same class of
defect as a unit test that does. Both must produce positive end-
user evidence; both are subject to the anti-bluff constraint rules
and captured-evidence requirement.

## MANDATORY ANTI-BLUFF VALIDATION (Constitution §8.1 + §11) (CONST-035)

**This submodule inherits the parent ATMOSphere project's anti-bluff covenant.
A test that PASSes while the feature it claims to validate is unusable to an
end user is the single most damaging failure mode in this codebase. It has
shipped working-on-paper / broken-on-device builds before, and that MUST NOT
happen again.**

The canonical authority is `docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md` §8.1
("NO BLUFF — positive-evidence-only validation") and §11 ("Bleeding-edge
ultra-perfection") in the parent repo. Every contribution to THIS submodule
is bound by it. Summarised non-negotiables:

1. **Tests MUST validate user-visible behaviour, not just metadata.** A gate
   that greps for a string in a config XML, an XML attribute, a manifest
   entry, or a build-time symbol is METADATA — not evidence the feature
   works for the end user. Such a gate is allowed ONLY when paired with a
   runtime / on-device test that exercises the user-visible path and reads
   POSITIVE EVIDENCE that the behaviour actually occurred (kernel `/proc/*`
   runtime state, captured audio/video, dumpsys output produced *during*
   playback, real input-event delivery, real surface composition, etc).
2. **PASS / FAIL / SKIP must be mechanically distinguishable.** SKIP is for
   environment limitations (no HDMI sink, no USB mic, geo-restricted endpoint
   unreachable) and MUST always carry an explicit reason. PASS is reserved
   for cases where positive evidence was observed. A test that completes
   without observing evidence MUST NOT report PASS.
3. **Every gate MUST have a paired mutation test in
   `scripts/testing/meta_test_false_positive_proof.sh` (parent repo).** The
   mutation deliberately breaks the feature and the gate MUST then FAIL.
   A gate without a paired mutation is a BLUFF gate and is a Constitution
   violation regardless of how many checks it appears to make.
4. **Challenges (HelixQA) and tests are in the same boat.** A Challenge that
   reports "completed" by checking the test runner exited 0, without
   observing the system behaviour the Challenge is supposed to verify, is a
   bluff. Challenge runners MUST cross-reference real device telemetry
   (logcat, captured frames, network probes, kernel state) to confirm the
   user-visible promise was kept.
5. **The bar for shipping is not "tests pass" but "users can use the feature."**
   If the on-device experience does not match what the test claims, the test
   is the bug. Fix the test (positive-evidence harder), do not silence it.
6. **No false-success results are tolerable.** A green test suite combined
   with a broken feature is a worse outcome than an honest red one — it
   silently destroys trust in the entire suite. Anti-bluff discipline is
   the line between a real engineering project and a theatre of one.

When in doubt: capture runtime evidence, attach it to the test result, and
let a hostile reviewer (i.e. yourself, in six months) try to disprove that
the feature really worked. If they can, the test is bluff and must be hardened.

## Seventh Law inheritance (Anti-Bluff Enforcement, 2026-04-30)

In addition to the Sixth Law above, this submodule inherits Lava's **Seventh Law — Tests MUST Confirm User-Reachable Functionality (Anti-Bluff Enforcement)** when consumed by the Lava project (`vasic-digital/Lava`). The Seventh Law was added to Lava's `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-04-30 to mechanically enforce the Sixth Law: every test commit MUST carry a Bluff-Audit stamp (mutation/observed-failure/reverted protocol); every feature MUST pass a real-stack verification gate; release tags MUST be preceded by a real-device attestation; forbidden test patterns (mocking the SUT, verification-only assertions, ignored tests without follow-up, build-success-as-only-assertion) are pre-push-rejected; a recurring bluff hunt and a bluff discovery protocol apply.

The authoritative verbatim text lives in the parent Lava `CLAUDE.md` under "Seventh Law — Tests MUST Confirm User-Reachable Functionality (Anti-Bluff Enforcement)". This submodule MAY add stricter clauses but MUST NOT relax any of the seven Seventh-Law clauses. Both the submodule's own anti-bluff rules and Lava's Sixth + Seventh Laws are binding when consumed by Lava; the stricter of the two applies.

## Clause 6.L — Anti-Bluff Functional Reality Mandate (Operator's Standing Order)

Inherited verbatim from parent Lava `/CLAUDE.md` §6.L. The operator has invoked this mandate **TEN TIMES** across two working days. The 10th invocation (2026-05-05, after Phase 7 readiness was reported, when the operator commissioned the full rebuild-and-test-everything cycle for tag Lava-Android-1.2.3): "Rebuild Go API and client app(s), put new builds into releases dir (with properly updated version codes) and execute all existing tests and Challenges! Any issue that pops up MUST BE properly addressed by addressing the root causes (fixing them) and covering everything with validation and verification tests and Challenges!"

Every test, every Challenge Test, every CI gate added to or maintained in this submodule MUST do exactly one job: confirm the feature it claims to cover actually works for an end user, end-to-end, on the gating matrix. CI green is necessary, NEVER sufficient. Tests must guarantee the product works — anything else is theatre.

Inheritance is recursive. Sub-submodules MAY paste this clause verbatim; they MUST NOT abbreviate or relax it.

## Clause 6.O (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.O — Crashlytics-Resolved Issue Coverage Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.O. Every Crashlytics-recorded issue (fatal OR non-fatal) closed/resolved by any commit MUST gain (a) a validation test in the language of the crashing surface that reproduces the conditions, (b) a Challenge Test under `app/src/androidTest/kotlin/lava/app/challenges/` (client) or `tests/e2e/` (server) that drives the same user-facing path, and (c) a closure log at `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/<date>-<slug>.md` recording the issue ID, root-cause analysis, fix commit SHA, and links to the tests. `scripts/tag.sh` MUST refuse release tags whose CHANGELOG mentions Crashlytics fixes without matching closure logs. Marking a Crashlytics issue "closed" in the Console requires the test coverage to land first — never close-mark before the regression-immunity tests exist. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05, 2 Crashlytics-recorded crashes within minutes of the first Firebase-instrumented APK distribution (Lava-Android-1.2.3-1023, commit `e9de508`); post-mortem at `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/2026-05-05-firebase-init-hardening.md`. The operator's ELEVENTH §6.L invocation made this clause load-bearing.

## Clause 6.P (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.P — Distribution Versioning + Changelog Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.P. Every distribute action (Firebase App Distribution, container registry pushes, releases/ snapshots, scripts/tag.sh) MUST: (1) carry a strictly increasing versionCode (no re-distribution of already-published codes); (2) include a CHANGELOG entry — canonical file `CHANGELOG.md` at repo root + per-version snapshot at `.lava-ci-evidence/distribute-changelog/<channel>/<version>-<code>.md`; (3) inject the changelog into the App Distribution release-notes via `--release-notes`. `scripts/firebase-distribute.sh` REFUSES to operate when current versionCode ≤ last-distributed versionCode for the channel, OR when CHANGELOG.md lacks an entry for the current version, OR when the per-version snapshot file is missing. `scripts/tag.sh` enforces the same gates pre-tag. Re-distributing the same versionCode is forbidden across distribute sessions; idempotent retry within a single session is permitted. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 23:11 operator's TWELFTH §6.L invocation: "when distributing new build it must have version code bigger by at least one then the last version code available for download (already distribited). Every distributed build MUST CONTAIN changelog with the details what it includes compared to previous one we have published!"

## Clause 6.Q (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.Q — Compose Layout Antipattern Guard** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.Q. Forbids nesting vertically-scrolling lazy layouts (LazyColumn, LazyVerticalGrid, LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid) inside parents giving unbounded vertical space (verticalScroll, unbounded wrapContentHeight, LinearLayout-with-weight wrapper). Equivalent rule horizontally for LazyRow / LazyHorizontalGrid / LazyHorizontalStaggeredGrid. Per-feature structural tests + Compose UI Challenge Tests on the §6.I matrix are the load-bearing acceptance gates. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 23:51 operator-reported "Opening Trackers from Settings crashes the app" — TrackerSelectorList used LazyColumn nested in TrackerSettingsScreen's Column(verticalScroll). Closure log: `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/2026-05-05-tracker-settings-nested-scroll.md`. Pattern guard: `feature/tracker_settings/src/test/.../TrackerSelectorListLazyColumnRegressionTest.kt`. The operator THIRTEENTH §6.L invocation triggered this clause.

## CONST-036 — Continuation Document Maintenance Mandate (added 2026-05-07)

The file `docs/CONTINUATION.md` is the single-file source-of-truth handoff
document for resuming work across any CLI session. Every commit that changes
phase status, lands a new spec/plan, bumps a submodule pin, ships a release
artifact, discovers/resolves a known issue, or implements a directive MUST
update `docs/CONTINUATION.md` in the SAME COMMIT. The "Last updated" line
MUST track HEAD. Submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax this
clause. See root `CLAUDE.md` §6.S for the inherited clause text.

## Article XI §11.9 — Anti-Bluff Forensic Anchor (Cascaded)

> Verbatim user mandate: "We had been in position that all tests do execute
> with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the
> features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and
> execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the
> completion and full usability by end users of the product!"
>
> Operative rule: The bar for shipping is not "tests pass" but "users can
> use the feature." Every PASS in this codebase MUST carry positive runtime
> evidence captured during execution. No false-success results are tolerable.

### Bluff Taxonomy (cascaded from root CONSTITUTION.md)

- Wrapper bluff — assertions PASS but exit-code logic is buggy
- Contract bluff — advertises capability but rejects in dispatch
- Structural bluff — file exists but doesn't contain working code
- Comment bluff — comment promises behavior code doesn't have
- Skip bluff — t.Skip() without SKIP-OK: #<ticket> marker
## §6.R — No-Hardcoding Mandate (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.R. No connection address, port, header field name, credential, key, salt, secret, schedule, algorithm parameter, or domain literal shall appear as a string/int constant in tracked source code. Every such value MUST come from `.env` (gitignored), generated config class, runtime env var, or mounted file. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.T — Universal Quality Constraints (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.T. All four sub-points (Reproduction-Before-Fix, Resource Limits for Tests & Challenges, No-Force-Push, Bugfix Documentation) apply verbatim. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax any of §6.T.1–§6.T.4.

## §6.U — No sudo/su Mandate (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.U. Every use of `sudo` or `su` is strictly forbidden. Operations requiring elevated privileges MUST use container-based solutions from the `vasic-digital/Containers` submodule or be provided by local project/Submodule dependencies that build automatically. The pre-push hook rejects files containing `sudo ` or `su ` patterns. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.V — Container Emulators Mandate (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.V. Every Android emulator instance for Challenge Tests / UI verification MUST run inside a container managed by the `vasic-digital/Containers` submodule. Rootless Podman/Docker only. All tests execute inside containers. The §6.I matrix (API 28/30/34/latest, phone/tablet/TV) runs inside container-bound emulators. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.W — GitHub + GitLab Only Remotes (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.W. Only GitHub (`vasic-digital/*`, `HelixDevelopment/*`) and GitLab (`vasic-digital/*`, `HelixDevelopment/*`) are permitted as Git remotes. GitFlic, GitVerse, and all other providers are forbidden. The 4-mirror model is replaced by 2-mirror (GitHub + GitLab). This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.
