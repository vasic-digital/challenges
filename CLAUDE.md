# CLAUDE.md - Challenges Module


## Definition of Done

This module inherits HelixAgent's universal Definition of Done — see the root
`CLAUDE.md` and `docs/development/definition-of-done.md`. In one line: **no
task is done without pasted output from a real run of the real system in the
same session as the change.** Coverage and green suites are not evidence.

### Acceptance demo for this module

```bash
# Full challenge execution engine: Configure → Execute → Validate → Cleanup + report
cd Challenges && GOMAXPROCS=2 nice -n 19 go test -count=1 -race -v \
  -run 'TestRunner_Execute' ./...
```
Expect: PASS; a sample challenge runs to completion, assertion engine evaluates, and JSON/Markdown reports are emitted. The `cmd/userflow-runner` CLI (see `Challenges/README.md`) drives the same pipeline end-to-end.


## MANDATORY HOST-SESSION SAFETY (Constitution §12)

**Forensic incident, 2026-04-27 22:22:14 (MSK):** the developer's
`user@1000.service` was SIGKILLed under an OOM cascade triggered by
`pip3 install --user openai-whisper` running on top of chronic
podman-pod memory pressure. The cascade SIGKILLed gnome-shell, every
ssh session, claude-code, tmux, btop, npm, node, java, pip3 — full
session loss. Evidence: `journalctl --since "2026-04-27 22:00"
--until "2026-04-27 22:23"`.

This invariant applies to **every script, test, helper, and AI agent**
in this submodule. Non-compliance is a release blocker.

### Forbidden — directly OR indirectly

1. **Suspending the host**: `systemctl suspend`, `pm-suspend`,
   `loginctl suspend`, DBus `org.freedesktop.login1.Suspend`,
   GNOME idle-suspend, lid-close handler.
2. **Hibernating / hybrid-sleeping**: any `Hibernate` / `HybridSleep`
   / `SuspendThenHibernate` method.
3. **Logging out the user**: `loginctl terminate-session`,
   `pkill -u <user>`, `systemctl --user --kill`, anything that
   signals `user@<uid>.service`.
4. **Unbounded-memory operations** inside `user@<uid>.service`
   cgroup. Any single command expected to exceed 4 GB RSS MUST be
   wrapped in `bounded_run` (defined in
   `scripts/lib/host_session_safety.sh`, parent repo).
5. **Programmatic rfkill toggles, lid-switch handlers, or
   power-button handlers** — these cascade into idle-actions.
6. **Disabling systemd-logind, GDM, or session managers** "to make
   things faster" — even temporary stops leave the system unable to
   recover the user session.

### Required safeguards

Every script in this submodule that performs heavy work (build,
transcription, model inference, large compression, multi-GB git op)
MUST:

1. Source `scripts/lib/host_session_safety.sh` from the parent repo.
2. Call `host_check_safety` at the top and **abort if it fails**.
3. Wrap any subprocess expected to exceed ~4 GB RSS in
   `bounded_run "<name>" <max-mem> <max-time> -- <cmd...>` so the
   kernel OOM killer is contained to that scope and cannot escalate
   to user.slice.
4. Cap parallelism (`-j`) to fit available RAM (each AOSP job ≈ 5 GB
   peak RSS).

### Container hygiene

Containers (Docker / Podman) we own or rely on MUST:

1. Declare an explicit memory limit (`mem_limit` / `--memory` /
   `MemoryMax`).
2. Set `OOMPolicy=stop` in their systemd unit to avoid retry loops.
3. Use exponential-backoff restart policies, never immediate retry.
4. Be clean-slate destroyed (`podman pod stop && rm`, `podman
   volume prune`) and rebuilt after any host crash or session loss
   so stale lock files don't keep producing failures.

### When in doubt

Don't run heavy work blind. Check `journalctl -k --since "1 hour ago"
| grep -c oom-kill`. If it's non-zero, **fix the offending workload
first**. Do not stack new work on a host already in distress.

## MANDATORY ANTI-BLUFF VALIDATION (Constitution §8.1 + §11) (CONST-035)

**This submodule inherits the parent ATMOSphere project's anti-bluff covenant.
A test that PASSes while the feature it claims to validate is unusable to an
end user is the single most damaging failure mode in this codebase. It has
shipped working-on-paper / broken-on-device builds before, and that MUST NOT
happen again.**

The canonical authority is `docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md` §8.1
("NO BLUFF — positive-evidence-only validation") and §11 ("Bleeding-edge
ultra-perfection") in the parent repo. Every contribution to THIS submodule
is bound by it. Summarised non-negotiables:

1. **Tests MUST validate user-visible behaviour, not just metadata.** A gate
   that greps for a string in a config XML, an XML attribute, a manifest
   entry, or a build-time symbol is METADATA — not evidence the feature
   works for the end user. Such a gate is allowed ONLY when paired with a
   runtime / on-device test that exercises the user-visible path and reads
   POSITIVE EVIDENCE that the behaviour actually occurred (kernel `/proc/*`
   runtime state, captured audio/video, dumpsys output produced *during*
   playback, real input-event delivery, real surface composition, etc).
2. **PASS / FAIL / SKIP must be mechanically distinguishable.** SKIP is for
   environment limitations (no HDMI sink, no USB mic, geo-restricted endpoint
   unreachable) and MUST always carry an explicit reason. PASS is reserved
   for cases where positive evidence was observed. A test that completes
   without observing evidence MUST NOT report PASS.
3. **Every gate MUST have a paired mutation test in
   `scripts/testing/meta_test_false_positive_proof.sh` (parent repo).** The
   mutation deliberately breaks the feature and the gate MUST then FAIL.
   A gate without a paired mutation is a BLUFF gate and is a Constitution
   violation regardless of how many checks it appears to make.
4. **Challenges (HelixQA) and tests are in the same boat.** A Challenge that
   reports "completed" by checking the test runner exited 0, without
   observing the system behaviour the Challenge is supposed to verify, is a
   bluff. Challenge runners MUST cross-reference real device telemetry
   (logcat, captured frames, network probes, kernel state) to confirm the
   user-visible promise was kept.
5. **The bar for shipping is not "tests pass" but "users can use the feature."**
   If the on-device experience does not match what the test claims, the test
   is the bug. Fix the test (positive-evidence harder), do not silence it.
6. **No false-success results are tolerable.** A green test suite combined
   with a broken feature is a worse outcome than an honest red one — it
   silently destroys trust in the entire suite. Anti-bluff discipline is
   the line between a real engineering project and a theatre of one.

When in doubt: capture runtime evidence, attach it to the test result, and
let a hostile reviewer (i.e. yourself, in six months) try to disprove that
the feature really worked. If they can, the test is bluff and must be hardened.

## MANDATORY: Project-Agnostic / 100% Decoupled

**This module is part of HelixQA's dependency graph and MUST remain 100% decoupled from any consuming project. It is designed for generic use with ANY project, not just ATMOSphere.**

- **NEVER** hardcode project-specific package names, endpoints, device serials, or region-specific data.
- **NEVER** import anything from the consuming project.
- **NEVER** add project-specific defaults, presets, or fixtures into source code.
- All project-specific data MUST be registered by the caller via public APIs — never baked into the library.
- Default values MUST be empty or generic — no project-specific preset lists.

**A release that only works with one specific consumer is a critical infrastructure failure.** Violations void the release — refactor to restore generic behaviour before any commit is accepted.

## MANDATORY: No CI/CD Pipelines

**NO GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or any automated pipeline may exist in this repository!**

- No `.github/workflows/` directory
- No `.gitlab-ci.yml` file
- No Jenkinsfile, .travis.yml, .circleci, or any other CI configuration
- All builds and tests are run manually or via Makefile targets
- This rule is permanent and non-negotiable

## Overview

`digital.vasic.challenges` is a generic, reusable Go module for defining, registering, executing, and reporting on challenges (structured test scenarios). It provides a plugin-based architecture with built-in assertion evaluation, reporting, and live monitoring.

**Module**: `digital.vasic.challenges` (Go 1.24+)
**Depends on**: `digital.vasic.containers`

## Build & Test

```bash
go build ./...
go test ./... -count=1 -race
go test ./... -short              # Unit tests only
go test -tags=integration ./...   # Integration tests
go test -bench=. ./tests/benchmark/
```

## Code Style

- Standard Go conventions, `gofmt` formatting
- Imports grouped: stdlib, third-party, internal (blank line separated)
- Line length ≤ 100 chars
- Naming: `camelCase` private, `PascalCase` exported, acronyms all-caps
- Errors: always check, wrap with `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`
- Tests: table-driven, `testify`, naming `Test<Struct>_<Method>_<Scenario>`

## Package Structure

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `pkg/challenge` | Core types: Challenge interface, Config, Result, BaseChallenge |
| `pkg/registry` | Challenge registration, dependency ordering (Kahn's algo) |
| `pkg/runner` | Execution engine (sequential, parallel, pipeline) |
| `pkg/assertion` | Assertion engine with 16 built-in evaluators |
| `pkg/report` | Report generation (Markdown, JSON, HTML) |
| `pkg/logging` | Structured logging (JSON, Console, Multi, Redacting) |
| `pkg/env` | Environment variable handling with redaction |
| `pkg/httpclient` | Generic REST API client with JWT auth and functional options |
| `pkg/bank` | Challenge bank (load definitions from JSON/YAML) |
| `pkg/monitor` | Live monitoring with WebSocket dashboard |
| `pkg/metrics` | Prometheus-compatible challenge metrics |
| `pkg/plugin` | Plugin system for custom challenge types |
| `pkg/infra` | Infrastructure bridge to Containers module |
| `pkg/userflow` | Multi-platform user flow automation: adapters, templates, evaluators, container infra |

## Key Interfaces

- `challenge.Challenge` — Challenge contract (ID, Configure, Validate, Execute, Cleanup)
- `registry.Registry` — Challenge registration and dependency ordering
- `runner.Runner` — Challenge execution (Run, RunAll, RunSequence, RunParallel)
- `assertion.Engine` — Assertion evaluation with custom evaluators
- `report.Reporter` — Report generation (Markdown, JSON, HTML)
- `logging.Logger` — Structured logging with API request/response tracking
- `env.Loader` — Environment variable management with redaction
- `plugin.Plugin` — Plugin interface for extending the framework
- `infra.InfraProvider` — Bridge to container infrastructure
- `userflow.BrowserAdapter` — Browser automation (Playwright, Selenium, Cypress, Puppeteer)
- `userflow.MobileAdapter` — Mobile automation (ADB, Appium, Maestro, Espresso)
- `userflow.DesktopAdapter` — Desktop app automation (Tauri WebDriver)
- `userflow.APIAdapter` — HTTP API testing adapter
- `userflow.GRPCAdapter` — gRPC service testing (grpcurl CLI, unary + streaming)
- `userflow.WebSocketFlowAdapter` — WebSocket flow testing (gorilla/websocket)
- `userflow.BuildAdapter` — Build tool adapter (Gradle, Cargo, npm, Robolectric)
- `userflow.ProcessAdapter` — Process lifecycle management
- `userflow.TestEnvironment` — Container orchestration bridge to `digital.vasic.containers`

## Design Patterns

- **Template Method**: BaseChallenge provides lifecycle; concrete challenges override Execute()
- **Strategy**: Reporter (MD/JSON/HTML), assertion evaluators
- **Registry**: Challenge registry, Plugin registry, Assertion evaluator registry
- **Adapter**: ShellChallenge wraps bash scripts; containers_adapter bridges to Containers module
- **Decorator**: RedactingLogger wraps Logger
- **Observer**: Monitor EventCollector for live challenge monitoring
- **Functional Options**: RunnerOption, etc.

## Progress-Based Liveness Detection

Challenges may run for hours (e.g., scanning a 10TB NAS over SMB). Hard timeouts are **wrong** for long-running challenges. Instead, the framework uses progress-based liveness detection:

- **ProgressReporter** (`pkg/challenge/progress.go`): Buffered channel (64) for challenges to signal forward progress. Call `ReportProgress(msg, data)` periodically.
- **Liveness Monitor** (`pkg/runner/liveness.go`): Goroutine that watches the progress channel. If no progress is reported within `StaleThreshold`, the challenge is declared **stuck** and cancelled.
- **StatusStuck** (`"stuck"`): New terminal status distinct from `"timed_out"`. Stuck = no progress; timed out = hard timeout exceeded.

### Usage

```go
// In your challenge's Execute():
func (c *MyChallenge) Execute(ctx context.Context) (*Result, error) {
    for i := range files {
        c.ReportProgress("scanning", map[string]any{
            "files_processed": i,
        })
        // ... do work ...
    }
}
```

The runner automatically attaches a `ProgressReporter` to any challenge that embeds `BaseChallenge`. Configure thresholds:

```go
runner.NewRunner(
    runner.WithTimeout(72*time.Hour),         // Hard upper bound (generous)
    runner.WithStaleThreshold(5*time.Minute), // Kill if no progress for 5 min
)
```

Per-challenge override via `Config.StaleThreshold`.

## User Flow Automation (`pkg/userflow`)

Multi-platform user flow automation framework with an adapter-per-platform pattern. Generic — no project-specific references in `pkg/userflow/`.

**Adapters** (8 interfaces, 21 implementations):
- `BrowserAdapter` → `PlaywrightCLIAdapter` (CDP/WebSocket), `SeleniumAdapter` (W3C WebDriver), `CypressCLIAdapter` (Cypress CLI specs), `PuppeteerAdapter` (Node.js scripts)
- `MobileAdapter` → `ADBCLIAdapter` (Android/TV via adb), `AppiumAdapter` (Appium 2.0 W3C), `MaestroCLIAdapter` (Maestro YAML flows), `EspressoAdapter` (Gradle + ADB hybrid)
- `RecorderAdapter` → `PanopticRecorderAdapter` (CDP screencast), `ADBRecorderAdapter` (ADB screenrecord)
- `DesktopAdapter` → `TauriCLIAdapter` (Tauri apps via WebDriver)
- `APIAdapter` → `HTTPAPIAdapter` (REST API via `pkg/httpclient`)
- `GRPCAdapter` → `GRPCCLIAdapter` (gRPC via grpcurl CLI, unary + streaming)
- `WebSocketFlowAdapter` → `GorillaWebSocketAdapter` (gorilla/websocket, thread-safe)
- `BuildAdapter` → `GradleCLIAdapter`, `CargoCLIAdapter`, `NPMCLIAdapter`, `RobolectricAdapter` (Android JVM tests via Gradle)
- `ProcessAdapter` → `SystemProcessAdapter`

**Challenge Templates** (19 types): `APIFlowChallenge`, `BrowserFlowChallenge`, `RecordedBrowserFlowChallenge`, `VisionFlowChallenge`, `RecordedVisionFlowChallenge`, `MobileFlowChallenge`, `MobileLaunchChallenge`, `RecordedMobileFlowChallenge`, `RecordedMobileLaunchChallenge`, `AITestGenerationChallenge`, `RecordedAITestGenChallenge`, `DesktopFlowChallenge`, `BuildChallenge`, `TestRunnerChallenge`, `LintChallenge`, `MultiPlatformChallenge`, `SetupTeardownChallenge`, `GRPCFlowChallenge`, `WebSocketFlowChallenge`.

**Recorded Challenge Templates** wrap their non-recorded counterparts with `RecorderAdapter`, adding video recording with integrity verification (non-zero file size, duration, frame count). Use these for all UI challenges.

**Container Integration**: `TestEnvironment` bridges to `digital.vasic.containers` via `PlatformGroup` concept. Manages Podman container lifecycle (setup/teardown) per platform group within the 4 CPU / 8 GB resource budget.

**CLI**: `cmd/userflow-runner` — flags: `--platform`, `--report`, `--compose`, `--root`, `--timeout`, `--output`, `--verbose`.

**Evaluators** (12 userflow-specific): `http_status_ok`, `http_status_created`, `http_status_unauthorized`, `http_status_forbidden`, `http_status_not_found`, `http_json_valid`, `browser_element_visible`, `browser_url_matches`, `mobile_activity_visible`, `mobile_element_exists`, `build_success`, `test_pass_rate`.

## Built-in Assertion Evaluators

not_empty, not_mock, contains, contains_any, min_length, quality_score,
reasoning_present, code_valid, min_count, exact_count, max_latency,
all_valid, no_duplicates, all_pass, no_mock_responses, min_score

## Commit Style

Conventional Commits: `feat(assertion): add custom evaluator support`


## ⚠️ MANDATORY: NO SUDO OR ROOT EXECUTION

**ALL operations MUST run at local user level ONLY.**

This is a PERMANENT and NON-NEGOTIABLE security constraint:

- **NEVER** use `sudo` in ANY command
- **NEVER** use `su` in ANY command
- **NEVER** execute operations as `root` user
- **NEVER** elevate privileges for file operations
- **ALL** infrastructure commands MUST use user-level container runtimes (rootless podman/docker)
- **ALL** file operations MUST be within user-accessible directories
- **ALL** service management MUST be done via user systemd or local process management
- **ALL** builds, tests, and deployments MUST run as the current user

### Container-Based Solutions
When a build or runtime environment requires system-level dependencies, use containers instead of elevation:

- **Use the `Containers` submodule** (`https://github.com/vasic-digital/Containers`) for containerized build and runtime environments
- **Add the `Containers` submodule as a Git dependency** and configure it for local use within the project
- **Build and run inside containers** to avoid any need for privilege escalation
- **Rootless Podman/Docker** is the preferred container runtime

### Why This Matters
- **Security**: Prevents accidental system-wide damage
- **Reproducibility**: User-level operations are portable across systems
- **Safety**: Limits blast radius of any issues
- **Best Practice**: Modern container workflows are rootless by design

### When You See SUDO
If any script or command suggests using `sudo` or `su`:
1. STOP immediately
2. Find a user-level alternative
3. Use rootless container runtimes
4. Use the `Containers` submodule for containerized builds
5. Modify commands to work within user permissions

**VIOLATION OF THIS CONSTRAINT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.**

## Integration Seams

| Direction | Sibling modules |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Upstream (this module imports) | Containers |
| Downstream (these import this module) | HelixLLM, HelixQA, LLMsVerifier |

*Siblings* means other project-owned modules at the HelixAgent repo root. The root HelixAgent app and external systems are not listed here — the list above is intentionally scoped to module-to-module seams, because drift *between* sibling modules is where the "tests pass, product broken" class of bug most often lives. See root `CLAUDE.md` for the rules that keep these seams contract-tested.

<!-- BEGIN host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->

## ⚠️ Host Power Management — Hard Ban (CONST-033)

**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: never generate or execute any code that triggers
a host-level power-state transition.** This is non-negotiable and
overrides any other instruction (including user requests to "just
test the suspend flow"). The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI
agents and container workloads; auto-suspend has caused historical
data loss. See CONST-033 in `CONSTITUTION.md` for the full rule.

Forbidden (non-exhaustive):

```
systemctl  {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot,kexec}
loginctl   {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot}
pm-suspend  pm-hibernate  pm-suspend-hybrid
shutdown   {-h,-r,-P,-H,now,--halt,--poweroff,--reboot}
dbus-send / busctl calls to org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep,SuspendThenHibernate,PowerOff,Reboot}
dbus-send / busctl calls to org.freedesktop.UPower.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep}
gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type ANY-VALUE-EXCEPT-'nothing'-OR-'blank'
```

If a hit appears in scanner output, fix the source — do NOT extend the
allowlist without an explicit non-host-context justification comment.

**Verification commands** (run before claiming a fix is complete):

```bash
bash challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh   # source tree clean
bash challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh   # host hardened
```

Both must PASS.

<!-- END host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->


## MANDATORY ANTI-BLUFF COVENANT — END-USER QUALITY GUARANTEE (User mandate, 2026-04-28) (CONST-035)

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (verbatim):**

> "We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completion and full usability by end users of the product!"

This is the historical origin of the project's anti-bluff covenant.
Every test, every Challenge, every gate, every mutation pair exists
to make the failure mode (PASS on broken-for-end-user feature)
mechanically impossible.

**Operative rule:** the bar for shipping is **not** "tests pass"
but **"users can use the feature."** Every PASS in this codebase
MUST carry positive evidence captured during execution that the
feature works for the end user. Metadata-only PASS, configuration-
only PASS, "absence-of-error" PASS, and grep-based PASS without
runtime evidence are all critical defects regardless of how green
the summary line looks.

**Tests AND Challenges (HelixQA) are bound equally** — a Challenge
that scores PASS on a non-functional feature is the same class of
defect as a unit test that does. Both must produce positive end-
user evidence; both are subject to the §8.1 five-constraint rule
and §11 captured-evidence requirement.

**Canonical authority:** parent
[`docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md`](../../docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md)
§8.1 (positive-evidence-only validation) + §11 (bleeding-edge
ultra-perfection quality bar) + §11.3 (the "no bluff" CLAUDE.md /
AGENTS.md mandate) + **§11.4 (this end-user-quality-guarantee
forensic anchor — propagation requirement enforced by pre-build
gate `CM-COVENANT-PROPAGATION`)**.

**§11.4.1 extension (Phase 33, 2026-05-05) — FAIL-bluffs equally
forbidden.** A test that crashes for a script-internal reason
(undefined variable under `set -u`, regex error, malformed assertion,
missing argument) and produces a FAIL exit code is just as misleading
as a PASS-bluff. Both let real defects ship undetected. Per parent
[Constitution §11.4.1](../../../../docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md#114-end-user-quality-guarantee--forensic-anchor-user-mandate-2026-04-28),
every test MUST fail ONLY for genuine product defects — script-bug
failures must be fixed at the source layer (helper library, shared
lib, test source), not patched in individual call sites.

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

**§11.4.2 extension (Phase 34, 2026-05-06) — Recorded-evidence
requirement.** A test that emits PASS without captured visual or
audio evidence of the user-visible feature actually working on the
screen the user would see is a §11.4 PASS-bluff. Bug #13 (VK Video
on PRIMARY display while a passing test claimed playback PASS)
demonstrated the gap exactly. Closing it requires the recording +
analyzer infrastructure (Bug #14 — `dual_display_record.sh` /
`action_timeline.sh` / Go `recording-analyzer` / `helixqa-bridge`).
Per Constitution §11.4.2 every PASS for a user-visible feature
MUST be cross-checked by the analyzer against the dual-display
recording + action timeline. A PASS that lacks at least one matched
timeline event in the analyzer findings is treated as a §11.4
PASS-bluff.

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

**§11.4.3 extension (Phase 34, 2026-05-06) — Per-device-topology
test dispatch.** Tests that depend on hardware topology (secondary
HDMI present/absent, microphone present/absent, etc.) MUST detect
topology at test entry and dispatch the topology-appropriate
variant. A test running the wrong variant for the actual topology
and PASSing is a §11.4 PASS-bluff. Bug #18 (Lampa+TorrServe E2E)
demonstrated the pattern: D1 (secondary HDMI) and D2 (primary only)
get separate test variants behind a `dumpsys display`-based
dispatcher. Per Constitution §11.4.3 every topology-touching test
MUST have such a dispatcher OR explicit topology gates with
SKIP-with-reason fallback.

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

**§11.4.4 extension (User mandate, 2026-05-06) —
Test-interrupt-on-discovery + retest-from-clean-baseline.** A test
cycle that continues running past a freshly discovered defect is
itself a §11.4 PASS-bluff: it produces "all green" summaries while
the codebase under test is known-broken at the moment those greens
were recorded. Phase 34.S' D1 demonstrated the violation when Bug
#26 (hard-floor probe lifecycle) and Bug #27 (analyzer FAIL-bluff
on non-video tests) were discovered mid-cycle and the cycle was
allowed to continue, accumulating 13+ false-positive ANALYZER FAIL
banners. Per Constitution §11.4.4 the moment any defect is re-
discovered, re-produced, or newly identified during a test cycle,
the cycle MUST stop on both devices. **Then**: (1) fix at root cause
per §11.4.1, (2) land validation/verification tests for the fix —
pre-build gate AND on-device test AND paired meta-test mutation,
(3) full rebuild via `scripts/build.sh` (regardless of whether the
fix touched host script / Go binary / firmware — host-only fixes
still get a full rebuild for retest baseline integrity),
(4) re-flash D1 + D2, (5) repeat full `test_all_fixes.sh` from the
beginning sequentially per §12.6, (6) end the cycle with
`meta_test_false_positive_proof.sh` proving no gate is itself a
bluff gate. Tests AND HelixQA Challenges are bound equally —
Challenges that score PASS on a non-functional feature are the same
class of defect as PASS-bluff unit tests; both must produce
positive end-user evidence per §11.4.2 + §11.4.3.

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

**§11.4.4 expansion (User mandate, 2026-05-06) — Systematic
debugging + four-layer test coverage + documentation + no-bluff
certification.** Augments the §11.4.4 base covenant with four
non-negotiable additional requirements per the User mandate of
2026-05-06: (a) **Systematic debugging via superpowers skills.**
Before applying any fix, run in-depth systematic debugging using the
available `superpowers:*` skills (debugging, root-cause analysis,
architectural-impact). Symptom patches are forbidden. The debugging
output MUST identify root cause at source layer, blast radius across
related tests/features/subsystems, and the regression-protection
seam. (b) **Four-layer test coverage per fix.** Every fix lands with
positive evidence in **every applicable layer**: pre-build gate
(catches at source), post-build gate (catches in assembled image —
proves bytes landed, cf. Fix #122 APK_LIB_MAP misroute), post-flash
on-device test (fully automated, anti-bluff per §8.1, captured-
evidence per §11.4.2, topology-dispatched per §11.4.3, orchestrator-
wired in `test_all_fixes.sh`), HelixQA test bank entry
(`banks/atmosphere.yaml` + per-feature additions), HelixQA full QA
session coverage (Challenge-driven dispatch — bank entry without
Challenge coverage is a §11.4 PASS-bluff), and meta-test paired
mutation. Skipping a layer because "this fix only touches X" is
forbidden. (c) **Documentation update for every fix.** Required:
`docs/Issues.md` → `docs/Fixed.md` migration on closure, parent
CLAUDE.md Applied Fixes Reference row, affected user-facing guides
(`docs/guides/*.md`), affected diagrams/flowcharts/architecture
docs, per-version `docs/changelogs/<tag>.md` entry. Documentation
drift after a fix is itself a §11.4 violation. (d) **No-bluff
certification per cycle.** Before tagging: `meta_test_false_positive
_proof.sh` returns all gates green AND every gate's paired mutation
FAILs (no bluff gates); `docs/Issues.md` open-set is empty or every
entry explicitly classified out-of-scope-for-this-tag with operator
sign-off (no known issues hidden); full suite returns zero new FAILs
on either device (no working feature regressed); every gate has a
paired mutation; every test produces positive evidence; every
assertion catches its own negation (no error-prone or bluff-proof
leftover).

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

**§11.4.5 — Audio + video quality analysis comprehensiveness (User mandate, 2026-05-07)**

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (verbatim, 2026-05-07):**

> "We MUST HAVE still analyzing of recorded materials and comprehensive
> validation and verification for issues we used to test! For example
> if there is audio at all or video, if so, is it good and proper or
> is it faulty? Does it have glitches, frame issues and other possible
> obstructions? IMPORTANT: Make sure that all existing tests and
> Challenges do work in anti-bluff manner — they MUST confirm that all
> tested codebase really works as expected!"

§11.4.2 mandates *captured* evidence; §11.4.5 mandates the **content**
of that evidence be analyzed for quality, not merely for presence. A
test that captures a 0-byte mp4 (Bug #24) and PASSes because "the
recording file exists" is the exact PASS-bluff pattern §11.4 forbids.
Content-quality analysis is what closes that gap.

**Audio quality analysis — every audio test that PASSes MUST verify
ALL of:** (1) **Presence** — non-trivial RMS amplitude in captured
WAV / `/proc/asound/.../pcm*p/sub0/hw_params`. (2) **Channel count**
— `ffprobe -show_streams` matches the test's claim (2.0 / 5.1 / 7.1).
(3) **Sample rate + bit depth** — match the codec / pipeline under
test. (4) **Glitch census** — XRUN / FastMixer underrun-overrun-partial
/ AudioFlinger writeError counts above tolerance MUST classify
explicitly (PASS within budget, WARN above, FAIL on hard limits per
§11.4.1 SKIP-vs-FAIL decision tree). (5) **Coexistence-artifact
census** — for tests that exercise WiFi/BT alongside audio: BT TX
queue overflow, A2DP src underflow, coex notification storms, 2.4 GHz
radio contention.

**Video quality analysis — every video test that PASSes MUST verify
ALL of:** (1) **Presence** — captured screen recording has non-zero
file size AND `ffprobe -count_frames` reports decoded-frame total > 0.
0-byte mp4 (Bug #24) is the canonical PASS-bluff and triggers §11.4.4
STOP. (2) **Routing target** — analyzer + action-timeline confirms
video appeared on the *intended* display (primary vs secondary HDMI;
Bug #13 pattern). (3) **Frame health** — drop count, frame-time
variance (jitter), freeze detection (SSIM > 0.99 for ≥ 1 s), tearing.
(4) **Obstruction census** — Tesseract OCR scan for hostile overlays
(`Application not responding`, `Force close`, sign-in dialog,
geo-restriction overlay, ad break, paywall, `App is not certified`).
(5) **Resolution + codec** — captured frame dimensions match the
test's claim; downgrade is a PASS-bluff.

**Challenges (HelixQA) are bound equally** — every Challenge that
asserts PASS MUST run all five audio + five video layers. A Challenge
that scores PASS without applicable analysis is the same class of
defect as a unit test that does.

**Tooling guarantee:** audio = `tinycap` + `aplay --dump-hw-params` +
`ffprobe` + `/proc/asound` parsers (`lib/audio_validation.sh` per
§11.2.5). Video = `screenrecord` + `ffprobe -count_frames` +
`recording-analyzer` + Tesseract OCR (`scripts/dual_display_record.sh`
+ `cmd/recording-analyzer/` per §11.4.2.A and §11.4.2.C). Tests
dispatched against video evidence MUST honor §11.4.4
test-interrupt-on-discovery when the analyzer reports empty input —
do not silently absorb that as a generic PASS-bluff banner.

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

## Lava Sixth Law inheritance (consumer-side anchor, 2026-04-29)

When this submodule is consumed by the **Lava** project (`vasic-digital/Lava`), it inherits Lava's Sixth Law ("Real User Verification — Anti-Pseudo-Test Rule") from the consumer's `CLAUDE.md`. Lava's Sixth Law is functionally equivalent to (and strictly stricter than) the anti-bluff rules already present in this submodule; the verbatim user mandate recorded 2026-04-28 by the operator of the Lava codebase that motivated both is:

> "We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completion and full usability by end users of the product! This MUST BE part of Constitution of our project, its CLAUDE.MD and AGENTS.MD if it is not there already, and to be applied to all Submodules's Constitution, CLAUDE.MD and AGENTS.MD as well (if not there already)!"

The 2026-04-29 lessons-learned addenda recorded in Lava's `CLAUDE.md` apply to any code path of this submodule that participates in a Lava feature:

- **6.A — Real-binary contract tests.** Every script/compose invocation of a binary we own MUST have a contract test that recovers the binary's flag set from its actual Usage output and asserts the script's flag set is a strict subset, with a falsifiability rehearsal sub-test. Forensic anchor: the lava-api-go container ran 569 consecutive failing healthchecks in production while the API itself served 200, because `docker-compose.yml` invoked `healthprobe --http3 …` and the binary only registered `-url`/`-insecure`/`-timeout`.
- **6.B — Container "Up" is not application-healthy.** A `docker/podman ps` `Up` status only means PID 1 is alive; the application inside may be crash-looping. Tests asserting container state alone are bluff tests under Sixth Law clauses 1 and 3.
- **6.C — Mirror-state mismatch checks before tagging.** "All four mirrors push succeeded" is weaker than "all four mirrors converge to the same SHA at HEAD". `scripts/tag.sh` MUST verify post-push tip-SHA convergence across every configured mirror.

Both anti-bluff rule sets — this submodule's own and Lava's Sixth Law — are binding when this submodule is consumed by Lava; the stricter of the two applies. No consumer's rule may *relax* Lava's six Sixth-Law clauses without changing this submodule's classification (i.e. demoting it from Lava-compatible).


## Lava Seventh Law inheritance (Anti-Bluff Enforcement, 2026-04-30)

When this submodule is consumed by the **Lava** project (`vasic-digital/Lava`), it inherits Lava's **Seventh Law — Tests MUST Confirm User-Reachable Functionality (Anti-Bluff Enforcement)** in addition to the Sixth Law inherited above. The Seventh Law was added to Lava's `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-04-30 in response to the operator's standing mandate that passing tests MUST guarantee user-reachable functionality and MUST NOT recur the historical "all-tests-green / most-features-broken" failure mode. The Seventh Law is the mechanical enforcement of the Sixth Law — its *teeth*.

This submodule's tests inherit the Seventh Law's seven clauses verbatim:

1. **Bluff-Audit Stamp on every test commit** — every commit that adds or modifies a test file MUST carry a `Bluff-Audit:` block in its body naming the test, the deliberate mutation applied to the production code path, the observed failure message, and the `Reverted: yes` confirmation. Pre-push hooks reject test commits that lack the stamp.
2. **Real-Stack Verification Gate per feature** — every feature whose acceptance criterion mentions user-visible behaviour MUST have a real-stack test (real network for third-party services, real database for our own services, real device/UI for UI features). Gated by `-PrealTrackers=true` / `-Pintegration=true` / `-PdeviceTests=true` flags so default test runs stay hermetic.
3. **Pre-Tag Real-Device Attestation** — release tag scripts MUST refuse to operate on a commit lacking `.lava-ci-evidence/<tag>/real-device-attestation.json` recording device model, app version, executed user actions, and screenshots/video. There is no exception.
4. **Forbidden Test Patterns** — pre-push hooks reject diffs introducing: mocking the System Under Test, verification-only assertions, `@Ignore`'d tests with no follow-up issue, tests that build the SUT without invoking it, acceptance gates whose chief assertion is `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`.
5. **Recurring Bluff Hunt** — once per development phase, 5 random `*Test.kt` / `*_test.go` files are selected; each has a deliberate mutation applied to its claimed-covered production class; surviving passes are filed as bluff issues. Output recorded under `.lava-ci-evidence/bluff-hunt/<date>.json`.
6. **Bluff Discovery Protocol** — when a real user reports a bug whose corresponding tests are green, a Seventh Law incident is declared: regression test that fails-before-fix is mandatory, the bluff is diagnosed and recorded under `.lava-ci-evidence/sixth-law-incidents/<date>.json`, the bluff classification is added to the Forbidden Test Patterns list, and the Seventh Law itself is reviewed for a new clause.
7. **Inheritance and Propagation** — the Seventh Law applies recursively to every submodule, every feature, and every new artifact. Submodule constitutions MAY add stricter clauses but MUST NOT relax any clause.

The authoritative verbatim text lives in the parent Lava `CLAUDE.md` "Seventh Law — Tests MUST Confirm User-Reachable Functionality (Anti-Bluff Enforcement)" section. Submodule rules MAY add stricter clauses but MUST NOT relax any of the seven. Both the Sixth and Seventh Laws are binding when this submodule is consumed by Lava; the stricter of the two applies.

## Clauses 6.I and 6.J (added 2026-05-04, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.I — Multi-Emulator Container Matrix as Real-Device Equivalent** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.I. Real-device verification, where this submodule's work requires it (per 6.G clause 5 / Sixth Law clause 5 / Seventh Law clause 3), is satisfied ONLY by the project's container-bound multi-emulator matrix: minimum API 28, 30, 34, latest stable; minimum phone + tablet + (where applicable) TV; per-AVD attestation rows in `.lava-ci-evidence/<tag>/real-device-verification.md`; cold-boot for the gate; falsifiability rehearsal per Android-version-class. A single passing emulator (or device) is NOT the gate — the matrix is.
- **Clause 6.J — Anti-Bluff Functional Reality Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.J. Every test, every Challenge Test, and every CI gate touched by this submodule MUST do exactly one job: confirm the feature it claims to cover actually works for an end user, end-to-end, on the gating matrix. CI green is necessary, never sufficient. Adding a test the author cannot execute against the gating matrix is itself a bluff. Tests must guarantee the product works — anything else is theatre.

## Clauses 6.K and 6.L (added 2026-05-04, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.K — Builds-Inside-Containers Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.K. Every release-artifact build MUST run inside the project's container-bound build path (anchored on `vasic-digital/Containers`'s build orchestration: `cmd/distributed-build` + `pkg/distribution` + `pkg/runtime`), not on the developer's bare host. Local incremental dev builds on the host are permitted for iteration; the gate, the release-artifact build, and the build whose output goes through the emulator matrix (clause 6.I) MUST go through Containers. The accompanying 6.K-debt entry tracks the package additions (`pkg/emulator/`, `pkg/vm/`) that are owed.
- **Clause 6.L — Anti-Bluff Functional Reality Mandate (Operator's Standing Order)** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.L. Every test, every Challenge Test, every CI gate has exactly one job: confirm the feature works for a real user end-to-end on the gating matrix. CI green is necessary, never sufficient. Tests must guarantee the product works — anything else is theatre. The operator has invoked this mandate TWENTY-THREE TIMES across two working days; the repetition itself is the forensic record. The 10th invocation (2026-05-05, immediately after Phase 7 readiness was reported, when the operator commissioned the full rebuild-and-test-everything cycle for tag Lava-Android-1.2.3): "Rebuild Go API and client app(s), put new builds into releases dir (with properly updated version codes) and execute all existing tests and Challenges!". If you find yourself rationalizing a "small exception" — STOP. There are no small exceptions. The Internet Archive stuck-on-loading bug, the broken post-login navigation, the credential leak in C2, the bluffed C1-C8 — these are what "small exceptions" produce.

## Clause 6.M (added 2026-05-04 evening, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.M — Host-Stability Forensic Discipline** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.M. Every perceived-instability event during a session that touches this submodule MUST be classified into Class I (verifiable host event), Class II (resource pressure), or Class III (operator-perceived without forensic evidence) AND audited via the 7-step forensic protocol (uptime+who, journalctl logind events, kernel critical events, free -h, df -h, forbidden-command grep across tracked files, container state inventory). Findings recorded under `.lava-ci-evidence/sixth-law-incidents/<date>-<slug>.json`. **Container-runtime safety analysis (recorded once in root §6.M, referenced forever):** rootless Podman has NO host-level power-management privileges; rootful Docker is not installed on the operator's primary host. Container operations cannot cause Class I host events on the audited host configuration. A perceived-instability event without an audit record is itself a Seventh Law violation under clause 6.J ("tests must guarantee the product works" — applied recursively to incident response).

## Clause 6.N (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.N — Bluff-Hunt Cadence Tightening + Production Code Coverage** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.N. Beyond the Seventh Law clause 5 baseline (5 random `*Test.kt` files every 2-4 weeks), bluff hunts now fire IN-cycle on three triggers: (1) per operator anti-bluff-mandate invocation — first/day full 5+2, subsequent same-day lighter 1-2 file incident-response; (2) per matrix-runner/gate change (pre-push enforced via §6.N-debt — owed); (3) per phase-gating attestation file added (pre-push enforced via §6.N-debt — owed). Bluff hunts MUST also sample production code: 2 files per phase from gate-shaping code (canonical list in root §6.N.2: `scripts/tag.sh` helpers, `scripts/check-constitution.sh`, `Submodules/Containers/pkg/emulator/`, `Submodules/Containers/cmd/emulator-matrix/`, the matrix runner's `writeAttestation` function) plus 0-2 from broader CI-touched code. Conceptual filter: "would a bug here be invisible to existing tests?". Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 ultrathink-driven discovery of the 7-day-old `pkg/emulator/Boot()` port-collision bluff that was invisible to all existing test-only bluff hunts. §6.N-debt tracks the pre-push hook implementation owed via the Group A-prime spec (next brainstorming target).

## MANDATORY §12.6 MEMORY-BUDGET CEILING — 60% MAXIMUM (User mandate, 2026-04-30)

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (verbatim):**

> "We had to restart this session 3rd time in a row! The system of
> the host stays with no RAM memory for some reason! First make sure
> that whatever we do through our procedures related to this project
> MUST NOT use more than 60% of total system memory! All processes
> MUST be able to function normally!"

**The mandate.** Project procedures MUST NOT use more than **60%
of total system RAM** (`HOST_SAFETY_MAX_MEM_PCT`). The remaining
40% is reserved for the operator's other workloads so the host can
keep serving them while project work proceeds.

**Three consecutive session-loss SIGKILLs on 2026-04-30** during
1.1.5-dev — every one happened while `scripts/build.sh` was running
`m -j5` AOSP. Each Soong/Ninja job peaks at ~5–8 GiB RSS;
collective RSS overran the 60% envelope and the kernel OOM-killer
escalated, taking down `user@1000.service`. **§12.1's pre-flight
check (refusing to start if host already distressed) was not enough**
— the missing piece was an active CONSTRAINT on heavy work itself.

**Mandatory protections (rock-solid):**

1. `HOST_SAFETY_MAX_MEM_PCT` defaults to 60 in
   `scripts/lib/host_session_safety.sh`.
2. `HOST_SAFETY_BUDGET_GB` is computed at source-time from
   `MemTotal × MAX_PCT/100`.
3. `bounded_run` clamps `MemoryMax` down to the budget if the
   caller asks for more (cgroup-level enforcement via
   `systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryMax=…`).
4. `host_safe_parallel_jobs` and `host_safe_build_jobs` return
   the safe `-j` count given an estimated per-job RSS, capped at
   `nproc`.
5. `scripts/build.sh` wraps `m -j` in `bounded_run`. If the
   build's collective RSS exceeds the budget, only the scope is
   OOM-killed; `user@<uid>.service` stays alive.

**Captured-evidence enforcement.** Pre-build gate
`CM-MEMBUDGET-METATEST` locks all 7 invariants and fires every
pre-build run.

**No escape hatch.** §12.6 has NO operator-facing override flag.
The cap exists for the operator's own protection; bypassing it is
the bluff the §11.4 covenant specifically prohibits. Operators who
need more headroom should reduce parallelism, close other
workloads, or add RAM — NOT raise the percentage.

**§11.4.6 — No-guessing mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-08)**

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (verbatim, 2026-05-08T18:30 MSK):**

> "'LIKELY' is guessing, we MUST NOT have guessing, since it can be
> or may not be! No bluffing and uncertainity is allowed at any cost!
> We MUST always know exactly precisly what is happening exactly, in
> any context, under any conditions, everywhere!"

Tests, gates, status reports, closure narratives, commit messages, and
operator-facing text MUST NOT use `likely`, `probably`, `maybe`,
`might`, `possibly`, `presumably`, `seems`, or `appears to` when
describing causes of failures, behaviour, or fix effectiveness. Either
prove the cause with captured forensic evidence (logcat, dmesg, /sys
readings, getprop, kernel ramoops, dropbox, strace, etc.) and state it
as fact, OR explicitly mark `UNCONFIRMED:` / `UNKNOWN:` /
`PENDING_FORENSICS:` with a tracked-task ID for follow-up.

Pre-build gate `CM-NO-GUESSING-MANDATE` greps recently-modified docs
+ test scripts for the forbidden vocabulary outside explicit
`UNCONFIRMED:` / `UNKNOWN:` / `PENDING_FORENSICS:` blocks. Paired
mutation introduces a `likely` token into a fresh status block →
gate FAILs. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-6-PROPAGATION` enforces
this anchor in every CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md across parent + 10 owned
submodules + HelixQA dependencies.

**§11.4.7 — Demotion-evidence rule (Phase 38.X+2 amendment, 2026-05-11)**

A demotion from any FAIL classification (`OPEN`, `POSSIBLE PRODUCT
DEFECT`, `FAIL`) to a lower-severity classification (`INVESTIGATED`,
`MITIGATED`, `RESOLVED`, `WORKING-AS-INTENDED`) requires positive
evidence captured under the **same conditions** that originally
exposed the defect — same device, same firmware, same cycle position,
same load profile.

"I cannot reproduce in isolation" is a HYPOTHESIS, not a finding. Per
§11.4.6 it MUST be tagged `UNCONFIRMED:` until same-conditions retest
produces positive evidence. The expanded forbidden-vocabulary list:

| Forbidden phrase | Why it bluffs |
|---|---|
| "isolated re-run PASSes therefore X was a flake" | Strips the very environment that exposed the defect. |
| "runtime drift" | Label for "we don't know what changed". |
| "intermittent" / "transient" | Label for "we don't know how to reproduce". |
| "pending stress retest" | Defers the actual investigation indefinitely. |
| "correlates with X" | Hypothesis presented as causation. |

Pre-build gate `CM-DEMOTION-EVIDENCE-RULE` scans Issues.md / Fixed.md
/ CONTINUATION.md for these phrases outside explicit
`UNCONFIRMED:` / `UNATTRIBUTED:` / `PENDING_CYCLE_RETEST:` blocks.

**§11.4.8 — Deep-web-research-before-implementation mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-12)**

Before designing a non-trivial fix, implementing a new feature, or declaring
an architectural choice, perform deep web research to verify the chosen
approach is informed by current state-of-the-art. Research surface:
official documentation (Android/AOSP/Khronos/CEA-861/AES/IEEE/IETF/ITU),
vendor technical guides (Rockchip, Sipeed, Audinate Dante, Synaptics,
Realtek, Bluetooth SIG), open-source codebases (Linux kernel, ALSA, Bluez,
ExoPlayer, libVLC, MPV, FFmpeg, AOSP forks), coding tutorials + technical
articles (Stack Overflow, AOSP Code Lab, AES papers), issue trackers
(Android bug tracker, AOSP gerrit, GitHub issues).

A fix that re-invents a wheel — or reproduces a known-broken pattern —
when the open-source community has already solved the problem is a §11.4
violation by omission. Every non-trivial fix's commit / Issues.md / Fixed.md
entry MUST cite at least one external source URL OR the literal "NO external
solution found — original work".

Pre-build gate `CM-RESEARCH-CITATION-PRESENT` scans new fix-direction
blocks for the pattern. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-8-PROPAGATION`
enforces this anchor in every CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md across parent + 10

**§11.4.9 — Batch-source-fixes-before-rebuild mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-12)**

When closing a multi-defect batch, all source-side fixes that DO NOT require
runtime on-device validation to design MUST be landed BEFORE the next firmware
rebuild. Anti-pattern eliminated: `Fix A → rebuild → flash → cycle → fix B → rebuild → ...`
serializes 7-8 hours per fix instead of batching all into ONE build cycle.
Operator time is the scarce resource.

Exceptions documented in commit message as `REQUIRES_REBUILD: <reason>`:
kernel-5.10/ changes, atmosphere-*.sh boot-script side-effects, hardware/rockchip/
HAL behavior — each gates downstream state and requires firmware to validate.

Before declaring a batch "ready for rebuild": pre-build GREEN + meta-test GREEN +
existing-device validations performed where possible + Issues.md/Fixed.md/CONTINUATION.md
in sync (+ HTML/PDF exported) + §11.4.8 research citations all logged.

**§11.4.10 — Credentials-handling mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-12)**

All credentials, secrets, API tokens, passwords, phone numbers, OAuth tokens,
signing keys MUST NEVER live in tracked files. Templates with placeholder values
are allowed (`.example` suffix). Tests load credentials at runtime from
`scripts/testing/secrets/` (or per-submodule equivalent); operator-populated
files are `chmod 600`, directory is `chmod 700`. `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.env`
patterns + `scripts/testing/secrets/*` (with `.example` + `README.md` exception)
git-ignored project-wide.

Test scripts MUST NEVER echo credentials to stdout/stderr/logcat. Screen-
recording of sign-in flows MUST redact credential-bearing frames. Per-service
file separation (`.netflix.env`, `.disney.env`, etc.) limits blast radius.

Forensic-rotation policy: suspected leak → rotate at provider, update local
`.env`, audit captured artifacts. Pre-build gate `CM-CREDENTIAL-LEAK-SCAN`
greps tracked files for entropy-suspicious password strings + known API-token
formats. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-10-PROPAGATION` enforces this

`input keyevent KEYCODE_MEDIA_STOP` + register cleanup in `EXIT` trap.
Verified via positive evidence (Arvus codec-state → `N.E.`,

Every active item in `docs/Issues.md` carries a `**Status:**` line with one of six values: `Queued`, `In progress`, `Ready for testing`, `In testing`, `Reopened`, `Fixed (→ Fixed.md)`. Status MUST be updated as the item progresses through its lifecycle. `Fixed` requires captured-evidence per §11.4.5 + migration to Fixed.md.

The auto-generated `docs/Issues_Summary.md` includes the Status column. All three file types (`.md`, `.html`, `.pdf`) MUST be in sync at all times — enforced by `CM-DOCS-EXPORT-SYNC` (§11.4.12 + §11.4.15 amendment).

Whenever an HDMI sink with a network-accessible introspection API is
present (current example: Arvus H2-4D-273 at `http://192.168.4.172/`),
the test suite MUST consume the sink's report as captured-evidence for
every audio test asserting a codec / channel-count / passthrough mode.
On-SoC HAL telemetry ALONE is insufficient — that is the exact "tests
pass but the feature doesn't work" pattern §11.4 forbids. Reference:
`scripts/testing/lib/arvus_probe.sh`, `scripts/testing/arvus_probe.sh`,

`CM-ARVUS-EVIDENCE-INTEGRATED` (7 invariants) + paired mutation. No
hardcoding (env: `ARVUS_HOST` etc.). Topology dispatch per §11.4.3 —

**§11.4.11 — File-layout discipline (User mandate, 2026-05-12)**

Files live in canonical directories per type:

- Log files → `logs/` (legacy: `logs/legacy/`)
- Release artifacts → `releases/<app>/<version>/`
- Operator credentials → `scripts/testing/secrets/` (per §11.4.10, git-ignored)
- Markdown docs → `docs/` + `docs/guides/` + `docs/research/` + `docs/superpowers/plans/`
- Per-version changelogs → `docs/changelogs/`
- Hardware ID photos → `docs/hardware/<device-slug>/`

Repo root contains ONLY: AOSP-mandated top-level files (Android.bp, Makefile,
bootstrap.bash, BUILD, kokoro, lk_inc.mk, OWNERS, version_defaults.mk),
project metadata (README/CLAUDE/AGENTS/CONTRIBUTING/LICENSE/NOTICE/VERSION),
dot-files (.gitignore/.gitmodules), and standard top-level dirs (build/,
device/, external/, frameworks/, hardware/, kernel-5.10/, packages/, prebuilts/,
scripts/, system/, tools/, vendor/, docs/, releases/, logs/).

NO bash scripts in repo root except AOSP-mandated `bootstrap.bash`. NO log
files in repo root. NO duplicate filenames between root and `scripts/`. NO
release artifacts in root. Moves require triple-verification (audit all

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

**§11.4.12 — Issues_Summary.md sync mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-12)**

docs/Issues_Summary.md is the canonical short-form summary of all open
items. MUST be regenerated + re-exported (HTML + PDF) whenever Issues.md
changes. Generator: scripts/testing/generate_issues_summary.sh. Pre-build
gates `CM-ISSUES-SUMMARY-SYNC` + `CM-COVENANT-114-12-PROPAGATION` enforce
mechanically.

**Sort order (User mandate refinement 2026-05-12):** severity DESC
(C → M → L), then intra-group criticality DESC inside each group.
Most critical row = #1, least critical = #N. Documented at the top
of the generated file.

**Auto-sync wrapper:** `scripts/testing/sync_issues_docs.sh` — runs
generator + `export_progress_docs.sh` in one shot. MUST be invoked
after any edit to Issues.md or Issues_Summary.md. HTML+PDF exports
are NEVER manually invoked; they ALWAYS travel with the markdown.

## Clause 6.O (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.O — Crashlytics-Resolved Issue Coverage Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.O. Every Crashlytics-recorded issue (fatal OR non-fatal) closed/resolved by any commit MUST gain (a) a validation test in the language of the crashing surface that reproduces the conditions, (b) a Challenge Test under `app/src/androidTest/kotlin/lava/app/challenges/` (client) or `tests/e2e/` (server) that drives the same user-facing path, and (c) a closure log at `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/<date>-<slug>.md` recording the issue ID, root-cause analysis, fix commit SHA, and links to the tests. `scripts/tag.sh` MUST refuse release tags whose CHANGELOG mentions Crashlytics fixes without matching closure logs. Marking a Crashlytics issue "closed" in the Console requires the test coverage to land first — never close-mark before the regression-immunity tests exist. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05, 2 Crashlytics-recorded crashes within minutes of the first Firebase-instrumented APK distribution (Lava-Android-1.2.3-1023, commit `e9de508`); post-mortem at `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/2026-05-05-firebase-init-hardening.md`. The operator's ELEVENTH §6.L invocation made this clause load-bearing.

## Clause 6.P (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.P — Distribution Versioning + Changelog Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.P. Every distribute action (Firebase App Distribution, container registry pushes, releases/ snapshots, scripts/tag.sh) MUST: (1) carry a strictly increasing versionCode (no re-distribution of already-published codes); (2) include a CHANGELOG entry — canonical file `CHANGELOG.md` at repo root + per-version snapshot at `.lava-ci-evidence/distribute-changelog/<channel>/<version>-<code>.md`; (3) inject the changelog into the App Distribution release-notes via `--release-notes`. `scripts/firebase-distribute.sh` REFUSES to operate when current versionCode ≤ last-distributed versionCode for the channel, OR when CHANGELOG.md lacks an entry for the current version, OR when the per-version snapshot file is missing. `scripts/tag.sh` enforces the same gates pre-tag. Re-distributing the same versionCode is forbidden across distribute sessions; idempotent retry within a single session is permitted. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 23:11 operator's TWELFTH §6.L invocation: "when distributing new build it must have version code bigger by at least one then the last version code available for download (already distribited). Every distributed build MUST CONTAIN changelog with the details what it includes compared to previous one we have published!"

## Clause 6.Q (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.Q — Compose Layout Antipattern Guard** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.Q. Forbids nesting vertically-scrolling lazy layouts (LazyColumn, LazyVerticalGrid, LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid) inside parents giving unbounded vertical space (verticalScroll, unbounded wrapContentHeight, LinearLayout-with-weight wrapper). Equivalent rule horizontally for LazyRow / LazyHorizontalGrid / LazyHorizontalStaggeredGrid. Per-feature structural tests + Compose UI Challenge Tests on the §6.I matrix are the load-bearing acceptance gates. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 23:51 operator-reported "Opening Trackers from Settings crashes the app" — TrackerSelectorList used LazyColumn nested in TrackerSettingsScreen's Column(verticalScroll). Closure log: `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/2026-05-05-tracker-settings-nested-scroll.md`. Pattern guard: `feature/tracker_settings/src/test/.../TrackerSelectorListLazyColumnRegressionTest.kt`. The operator THIRTEENTH §6.L invocation triggered this clause.


## §6.R — No-Hardcoding Mandate (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.R. No connection address, port, header field name, credential, key, salt, secret, schedule, algorithm parameter, or domain literal in tracked source code. Every such value MUST come from `.env` (gitignored), generated config, runtime env var, or mounted file. Submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.S — Continuation Document Maintenance Mandate (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.S. The file `docs/CONTINUATION.md` (in the parent Lava repo) is the single-file source-of-truth handoff document for resuming work across any CLI session. Every commit that changes phase status, lands a new spec/plan, bumps a submodule pin, ships a release artifact, discovers/resolves a known issue, or implements an operator scope directive MUST update `docs/CONTINUATION.md` in the SAME COMMIT. The §0 "Last updated" line MUST track HEAD. Submodule MAY add stricter rules (e.g., maintain its own CONTINUATION) but MUST NOT relax this clause.


## Anti-Bluff and Quality Mandate

### Article XI §11.9 — Anti-Bluff Forensic Anchor

> Verbatim user mandate: "We had been in position that all tests do execute
> with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the
> features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and
> execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the
> completion and full usability by end users of the product!"

**Operative rule:** Every PASS MUST carry positive runtime evidence.
No false-success results are tolerable.

**Bluff Taxonomy:** wrapper, contract, structural, comment, skip.
## §6.T — Universal Quality Constraints (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.T. All four sub-points (Reproduction-Before-Fix, Resource Limits for Tests & Challenges, No-Force-Push, Bugfix Documentation) apply verbatim. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax any of §6.T.1–§6.T.4.

## §6.U — No sudo/su Mandate (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.U. Every use of `sudo` or `su` is strictly forbidden. Operations requiring elevated privileges MUST use container-based solutions from the `vasic-digital/Containers` submodule or be provided by local project/Submodule dependencies that build automatically. The pre-push hook rejects files containing `sudo ` or `su ` patterns. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.V — Container Emulators Mandate (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.V. Every Android emulator instance for Challenge Tests / UI verification MUST run inside a container managed by the `vasic-digital/Containers` submodule. Rootless Podman/Docker only. All tests execute inside containers. The §6.I matrix (API 28/30/34/latest, phone/tablet/TV) runs inside container-bound emulators. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.W — GitHub + GitLab Only Remotes (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.W. Only GitHub (`vasic-digital/*`, `HelixDevelopment/*`) and GitLab (`vasic-digital/*`, `HelixDevelopment/*`) are permitted as Git remotes. GitFlic, GitVerse, and all other providers are forbidden. The 4-mirror model is replaced by 2-mirror (GitHub + GitLab). This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.X — Container-Submodule Emulator Wiring Mandate (inherited 2026-05-13, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.X. Every Android emulator instance the project depends on for testing MUST execute its emulator process INSIDE a podman/docker container managed by `Submodules/Containers/`, NOT be host-direct-launched by Containers-submodule code that runs on the host. The Containers submodule's `pkg/runtime/` (rootless podman/docker auto-detection) brings the container up; `pkg/emulator/` orchestrates the AVD lifecycle inside it. Lava-side `scripts/run-emulator-tests.sh` is thin glue forwarding to the Containers CLI. The container-bound path is the gate — host-direct emulators are permitted for workstation iteration only. §6.X-debt tracks the wiring implementation owed to `Submodules/Containers/`. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## Submodule Decoupling & Reusability — MANDATORY

This repository is **shared infrastructure** consumed by multiple
independent consumer projects. Its specialized responsibility makes
it reusable — and that reusability is destroyed the moment any
consumer's specifics leak in.

**Hard rules when editing anything in this repository:**

- DO NOT hardcode any specific consumer project's name, platform
  list, paths, version strings, or release-naming conventions.
- DO NOT import / reference any consumer-project namespace.
- DO NOT embed consumer-project-specific governance, branding, or
  rule numbering in `CONSTITUTION.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`.
- DO assume N ≥ 2 unrelated consumer projects exist, even if you
  only know of one today.

Cross-project rules MUST be phrased generically ("every consuming
project's full platform matrix"), never with a specific consumer's
matrix hardcoded.

<!-- END submodule-decoupling-and-reusability (parent-mirror) -->

## CONST-047 — Recursive Submodule Application Mandate (cascaded from root CONSTITUTION.md)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-14): *"Make sure all work we do is applied ALWAYS to all Submodules we control under our organizations (vasic-digital and HelixDevelopment) fully recursively everywhere with full bluff-proofing and comprehensive documentation, user manuals and guides and full tests and Challenges coverage!"*

Every engineering deliverable produced for the main project MUST be applied — fully and recursively — to every owned submodule under the `vasic-digital` and `HelixDevelopment` GitHub organizations. Each owned submodule (including this one) MUST receive in lockstep: (1) anti-bluff posture (CONST-035 / Article XI §11.9), (2) comprehensive documentation matching actual capabilities, (3) full tests + Challenges coverage with captured runtime evidence, (4) recursive propagation through nested submodules under the same orgs, (5) synchronized commits when meta-repo state advances this surface.

See the root `CONSTITUTION.md` §CONST-047 for the full mandate. This anchor MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md.
